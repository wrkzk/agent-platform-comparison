# AI Agent Platform Comparison
In this repo, I compare three different agent builder libraries to assess their relative advantages and disadvantages. The three libraries that I decided to compare are LangChain, Langroid, and the SmythOS SDK. To carry out this comparison, I completed the same task in all three platforms: building a very simple agent that uses RAG to respond to user queries based on a given document.

## Overview
[LangChain]([url](https://www.langchain.com/)) is the established dominant platform for agentic AI. While it covers many use cases and has a very feature rich set of tools and integrations, many users are dissatisfied with the perceived bloat and complexity that comes with using LangChain. [Langroid]([url](https://langroid.github.io/langroid/)), another platform for agentic AI, seeks to solve this issue, but creating a more streamlined developer experience. Finally, [SmythOS]([url](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre)) is a relative newcomer to the field of agentic AI, having recently open-sourced their SDK and SRE.
