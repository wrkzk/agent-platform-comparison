# AI Agent Platform Comparison
In this repo, I compare three different agent builder libraries to assess their relative advantages and disadvantages. The three libraries that I decided to compare are LangChain, Langroid, and the SmythOS SDK. To carry out this comparison, I completed the same task in all three platforms: building a very simple agent that uses RAG to respond to user queries based on a given document.
