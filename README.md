# AI Agent Platform Comparison
In this repo, I compare three different agent builder libraries to assess their relative advantages and disadvantages. The three libraries that I decided to compare are LangChain, Langroid, and the SmythOS SDK. To carry out this comparison, I completed the same task in all three platforms: building a very simple agent that uses RAG to respond to user queries based on a given document.

## Overview
LangChain is the established dominant platform for agentic AI. While it covers many use cases and has a very feature rich set of tools and integrations, many users are dissatisfied with the perceived bloat and complexity that comes with using LangChain. Langroid, another platform for agentic AI, seeks to solve this issue, but creating a much more streamlined developer experience.
